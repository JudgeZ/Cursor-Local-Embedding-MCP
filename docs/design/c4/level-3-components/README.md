# Level 3 — Component Diagram Stub

## Scope
- Break down each container into major components, modules, and internal collaborators.
- Describe responsibilities, data contracts, and control flows among components.
- Capture security, observability, and extensibility considerations that influence component design.

## Required Mermaid Diagrams
```mermaid

```
- Component diagram per container, illustrating interfaces and dependencies.
- Additional sequence diagrams for critical user journeys or data processing pipelines.
