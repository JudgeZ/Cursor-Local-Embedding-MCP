# Level 4 — Code Diagram Stub

## Scope
- Detail how critical components are implemented at the class, module, or function level.
- Explain technology choices, key algorithms, and error-handling or security patterns.
- Provide guidance for tracing requirements to concrete source files and test suites.

## Required Mermaid Diagrams
```mermaid
%% Placeholder: replace with a code-level diagram (e.g., class or sequence diagram) for high-value flows.
```
- Code-level class/module diagrams covering the most important components.
- Supporting sequence diagrams for complex logic, background jobs, or integrations.
