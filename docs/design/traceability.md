# Architecture Traceability Index

This index links the architecture commitments in the finalized overview to the subsystem specifications, required failing tests, and security review artifacts that collectively deliver the platform. Use it during planning and pull-request review to verify that each commitment has design depth, executable coverage, and documented mitigations. Cross-reference the [External References Catalog](../references/sources.md) for the authoritative sources that back each checklist and subsystem expectation.

## Traceability Map

## Gap Analysis & Follow-Up Actions

1. **WSL-specific validation coverage** – The architecture promises resilient WSL transport interop and log persistence, yet no failing tests currently target WSL-specific flows inside the transport or storage matrices. Author new failing scenarios under the Client Tooling and Secure Storage suites that exercise WSL path translation and DPAPI-backed key recovery, then document the expected telemetry in the relevant design specs. (_Owners_: transport + encryption teams.)
2. **Archive quota enforcement details** – While the test matrix enumerates Archive Extraction Quotas, the ingestion design only references quotas at a high level. Extend `docs/design/ingestion.md` with explicit quota calculation algorithms, latency budgets, and failure handling so the tests can trace back to concrete requirements. (_Owner_: ingestion team.)
3. **Security checklist coverage alignment** – Newly documented [Authentication](../security/threat-model.md#authentication-checklist), [Access Control](../security/threat-model.md#access-control-checklist), [File Handling](../security/threat-model.md#file-handling-checklist), and [Key Management](../security/threat-model.md#key-management-checklist) checklists now exist in `docs/security/threat-model.md`. Ensure future design updates link to the correct sections and capture checklist evidence in PRs. (_Owner_: security documentation team.)
4. **Offline-first resilience testing** – Ensure the newly documented Offline Resilience & Replay matrix scenarios are implemented and wired into CI so degraded-network regressions fail fast. Capture replay telemetry samples alongside the fixtures referenced in the transport and ingestion specs. (_Owner_: cross-functional runtime team.)

## Using This Index During Planning and Review

- Planning must follow the repository-wide workflow in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md), ensuring implementation plans cite the design and testing entries above before coding begins.
- During PR review, complete the [PR release checklist](../process/pr-release-checklist.md) and reference this traceability map when confirming design updates, failing test evidence, and security checklist coverage.
