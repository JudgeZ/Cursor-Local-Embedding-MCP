# Documentation Review Workflow

## Purpose and Scope
This workflow governs recurring reviews of documentation that guide implementation work.
It covers:
- Design specifications in `docs/design/` and related diagrams or data flows.
- Security updates documented in `docs/security/` and associated mitigations.
- Integration guides for clients, SDKs, and tooling across the repository.

## Roles and Responsibilities
- **Documentation Review Lead:** Coordinates the review cycle, circulates agendas, and ensures stakeholders receive pre-reading materials for design, security, and integration updates.
- **Security Reviewer:** Focuses on security narratives, confirming mitigations align with the latest threat models and regulatory requirements.
- **Integration Owner(s):** Represent CLI, SDK, IDE, and platform touchpoints to verify integration guides remain actionable and accurate.
- **Documentation Scribe:** Captures feedback, decisions, action items, and due dates; prepares the consolidated review notes for archival.
- **Approval Panel:** Documentation Review Lead, Security Reviewer, and at least one Integration Owner must approve all changes before documentation is marked as ready for implementation planning or coding.

## Meeting Cadence
- **Primary cadence:** Conduct the documentation review during the monthly governance review held on the first business day of each month (see `docs/process/governance.md`).
- **Interim checkpoints:** Schedule ad-hoc sessions when critical design, security, or integration changes arise between governance meetings; these sessions must still record outcomes using the same tracking process.
- **Coordination:** The Documentation Review Lead synchronizes agendas with the Governance Lead so that documentation updates feed directly into governance decisions and pre-implementation planning.

## Review Procedure
1. **Preparation:** Owners submit proposed documentation updates at least two business days before the scheduled review.
2. **Walkthrough:** During the session, authors present updates covering design intent, security impacts, and integration workflows.
3. **Feedback Capture:** The Documentation Scribe records comments, required revisions, and responsible owners in the governance log (`docs/process/governance-log.md`).
4. **Resolution Tracking:** Each action item must include an assignee and due date; open items are revisited in subsequent governance meetings until closed.
5. **Approval Criteria:** Documentation is approved when required stakeholders sign off, all critical feedback is resolved, and any follow-up tasks are logged with clear owners and timelines.
6. **Publication:** Approved documents are updated in the repository with references to meeting notes or governance-log entries, ensuring teams can trace decisions before coding starts.

## Feedback and Escalations
- Use the governance log to track the status of feedback, linking to pull requests or issues when additional work is required.
- Escalate unresolved critical items to the Governance Lead for inclusion in the next governance agenda.
- Capture lessons learned or process adjustments and feed them back into `AGENTS.md` so future contributors adopt improved practices prior to implementation.
