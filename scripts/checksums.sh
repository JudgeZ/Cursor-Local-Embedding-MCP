# Placeholder for checksum generation and verification helper.
#
# Planned responsibilities:
# - Walk target directories, compute SHA-256 hashes, and write `.sha256` manifests.
# - Verify existing manifests during CI to detect fixture drift.
# - Support inclusion/exclusion patterns for large fixture corpora.
#
# Runtime requirements:
# - POSIX-compatible shell environment
# - `sha256sum`, `find`, `sort`, and related coreutils
#
# Implementation notes:
# - Provide `--verify` and `--update` modes mirroring the fixture management plan.
# - Emit deterministic output ordering to maintain stable diffs.
