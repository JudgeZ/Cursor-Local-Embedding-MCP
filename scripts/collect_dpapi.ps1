.SYNOPSIS
    Placeholder for the DPAPI recovery telemetry collector.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script will capture DPAPI recovery events, credential backups, and
    associated audit logs from a domain-joined Windows host. The final
    implementation should aggregate the telemetry into the fixture directories
    outlined in `docs/testing/fixtures-plan.md`.

.RUNTIME_REQUIREMENTS
    - PowerShell 7.3+ (pwsh)
    - Windows 11 22H2 or later with domain trust
    - Access to DPAPI recovery agent certificates and EventLog APIs

.NOTES
    - Plan to integrate with `scripts/trace_capture.sh` for cross-host workflows.
    - Emit structured JSON for CI ingestion and include checksum metadata.
