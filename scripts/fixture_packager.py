"""Placeholder for the shared fixture packager.

Planned responsibilities:
- Assemble shared fixture bundles for reuse across subsystems.
- Validate schema compatibility and versioning metadata before publishing.
- Provide subcommands for `build` and `validate` operations.

Runtime requirements:
- Python 3.11
- Third-party packages: `typer`, `pyyaml`, `rich`

Implementation notes:
- Support semantic version tagging to track fixture compatibility.
- Emit summary reports suitable for inclusion in pull request descriptions.
