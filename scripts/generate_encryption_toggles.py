"""Placeholder for encryption toggle dataset generator.

Planned responsibilities:
- Emit encryption toggle fixtures that describe algorithm permutations and
  platform-specific prerequisites.
- Integrate with TLS/DPAPI capture workflows to ensure consistent fixture state.
- Provide CLI switches for output location and profile selection.

Runtime requirements:
- Python 3.11
- Third-party packages: `click`, `cryptography`, `pyyaml`

Implementation notes:
- Ensure deterministic output ordering so checksum verification remains stable.
- Capture metadata about certificate thumbprints and rotation cadences.
