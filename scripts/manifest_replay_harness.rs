//! Placeholder for the manifest replay integration harness.
//!
//! Planned responsibilities:
//! - Replay ingestion manifests with configurable delay and fault injection
//!   settings to reproduce edge cases documented in the fixture plan.
//! - Emit deterministic logs and checkpoint artifacts for validation by Python
//!   tooling and test suites.
//! - Provide command-line options for input directories, delay intervals, and
//!   output destinations.
//!
//! Runtime requirements:
//! - Rust toolchain (1.76+ recommended)
//! - Candidate crates: async runtime (`tokio`), structured logging (`tracing`),
//!   CLI parsing (`clap`), serialization (`serde`).
//!
//! Implementation notes:
//! - Should integrate with the offline transport buffer utilities to coordinate
//!   multi-stage replay scenarios.
//! - Consider exposing library helpers so tests can drive the harness in-process.
