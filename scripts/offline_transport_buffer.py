"""Placeholder for the offline transport buffer manager.

Planned responsibilities:
- Capture, verify, and replay offline transport queues based on named profiles.
- Emit deterministic YAML/JSONL outputs suitable for fixture regeneration.
- Provide subcommands for `capture`, `verify`, and `replay` workflows documented
  in the fixture plan.

Runtime requirements:
- Python 3.11
- Third-party packages: `typer`, `rich`, `pyyaml`

Implementation notes:
- Consider bundling telemetry about buffer saturation and retry windows for later
  visualization.
- Support integration with `manifest_replay_harness.rs` to coordinate ingestion
  replays.
