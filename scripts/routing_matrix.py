"""Placeholder for the routing matrix generator.

Planned responsibilities:
- Generate multi-repository routing matrices and fan-out corpora for test fixtures.
- Produce golden transcripts for federation harnesses and fuzz-affinity hints.
- Provide subcommands aligning with `matrix`, `fanout`, `transcript`, and `fuzz`
  workflows in the fixture plan.

Runtime requirements:
- Python 3.11
- Third-party packages: `networkx`, `typer`

Implementation notes:
- Consider output validation to guard against inconsistent topology definitions.
- Surface metrics about graph structure (fan-out degree, coverage) for diagnostics.
