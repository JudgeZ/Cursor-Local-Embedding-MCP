"""Placeholder for manifest sanitization pipeline.

Planned responsibilities:
- Accept JSONL streams from the archive builder and redact sensitive fields before
  promoting them to golden artifacts.
- Enforce schema validation and optionally emit remediation reports for rejected
  records.
- Provide CLI switches for streaming vs. batch processing.

Runtime requirements:
- Python 3.11
- Third-party packages: `click`, `pyyaml`, `jsonschema` (final set TBD)

Implementation notes:
- Consider supporting stdin/stdout piping to allow `cargo run | python sanitize`
  workflows documented in the fixture plan.
- Emit structured metrics for integration with CI dashboards.
