# Placeholder for the TLS/Noise/DPAPI trace capture harness.
#
# Planned responsibilities:
# - Orchestrate capture sessions for TLS handshakes, Noise negotiations, and
#   DPAPI audits based on named profiles.
# - Stream captured data to fixture and golden directories while enforcing
#   deterministic naming and retention policies.
# - Provide helpers for Windows-to-WSL bridging via the transport proxy.
#
# Runtime requirements:
# - POSIX-compatible shell environment
# - `openssl`, `tshark`, `jq`, and standard coreutils
#
# Implementation notes:
# - Support profile-specific configuration files to avoid hardcoding secrets.
# - Emit structured logs for CI consumption and include dry-run validation.
