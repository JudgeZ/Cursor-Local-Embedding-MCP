"""Placeholder for filesystem event ordering validator.

Planned responsibilities:
- Load captured YAML event sequences and assert that event timestamps and
  dependency relationships preserve causal ordering.
- Surface diffs when event files diverge from expected baselines during fixture
  regeneration workflows.
- Offer optional normalization to collapse noisy metadata (e.g., temporary file
  handles) before comparison.

Runtime requirements:
- Python 3.11
- Third-party packages: `pyyaml`

Implementation notes:
- Provide both CLI usage (`python scripts/verify_event_order.py <path>`) and an
  importable API for integration with pytest fixtures.
- Consider exit codes that map to CI workflows (0 success, non-zero failure) and
  structured console output for machine parsing.
