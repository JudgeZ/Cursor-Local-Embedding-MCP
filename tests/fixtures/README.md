# Fixtures Placeholder Corpus

This directory mirrors the layout documented in `docs/testing/fixtures-plan.md`.
All assets are currently placeholder shells tracked for upcoming TDD work.
Refer to the subsystem README files for generation commands and ownership notes.

The filesystem mocks live under `tests/fixtures/filesystem/mock-events.yaml`; CI
and local regeneration workflows should point tools at that path until the real
capture pipeline lands.
