# Archive Fixture Placeholders

These files capture the planned archive scenarios for quota and overflow testing.
The real data will be generated by `cargo run --bin archive_builder` as described in
`docs/testing/fixtures-plan.md`. Placeholder checksum manifests record the future
`scripts/checksums.sh` invocation that will accompany the generated assets.
