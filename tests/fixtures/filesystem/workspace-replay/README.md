# Workspace Replay Transcripts

This directory contains deterministic filesystem replay transcripts generated by
running:

```bash
python scripts/record_fs_events.py \
  --config tests/fixtures/filesystem/mock-events.yaml \
  --replay-dir tests/fixtures/filesystem/workspace-replay/
```

The command emits three file families:

* `mock-events.yaml` (`mode: config`) enumerates the available scenarios and the
  source configuration.
* Scenario transcripts (`mode: replay`) include ordered events with
  `event_id`, `ts_ms`, and optional `depends_on` metadata.
* Metrics manifests (`mode: metrics`) capture latency histograms consumed by
  ingestion regression tests.

Before committing new captures, run
`python scripts/verify_event_order.py tests/fixtures/filesystem/workspace-replay/`
and confirm every replay file prints `OK âœ“`. Failures return non-zero exit codes
and list the offending metadata so ordering regressions are caught during review.
