# Node.js Client Transcript Fixtures

The Node.js fixtures are produced automatically by the GitHub Action that
regenerates the transcript corpus. Fetch the workflow artifact and unpack the
`node/` directory into this location before running the node test harness.
Manual edits or commits of generated fixtures are prohibited.
