# Security Fixture Placeholders

Security fixture placeholders cover encryption toggles, TLS configs, DPAPI
recovery traces, and performance windows. Actual captures will follow the
`scripts/generate_encryption_toggles.py` and `scripts/trace_capture.sh`
workflows described in `docs/testing/fixtures-plan.md`.
